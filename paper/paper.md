# Summary

Get rid of matplotlib and pprint modules in BoreFlow scripts. Only have in example notebooks




# Documentation and examples

`BoreFlow` is provided with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks that demonstrate its use. The notebooks cover:

- Estimation of diapycnal diffusivity from the spectral signal of turbulence

- Estimation of diapyncal diffusivity from the spectral signal of internal waves

- Fitting of the Garrett-Munk model spectrum to observed internal-wave spectra





<!-- Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% } -->
